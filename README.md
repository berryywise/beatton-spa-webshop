A roadmap from The Odin Project:

✔ - You should have at least two pages (a home page and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart). Let the user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both pages.

✔ - To your homepage, you can add whatever you’d like! A few images or information will be totally fine; it doesn’t have to be something fancy (oopsie) - it’s to test the concepts taught thus far.

✔ - On the shopping cart page, you should have the same navigation bar that displays the number of items currently in the cart. You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).

✔ - Build individual card elements for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.

✔ - Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust accordingly.

✔ - As usual, style your application so you can show it off! You have a host of options provided already.
